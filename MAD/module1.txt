Android development framework:
    The Android development framework is a comprehensive suite of tools and libraries that allow developers 
    to create applications for Android devices. 
    It includes:
        Android SDK (Software Development Kit): 
            Provides the essential libraries and tools needed to build, test, and debug Android applications.
        Android Studio: 
            The official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android development, offering a rich set of features to streamline the development process.
        Java and Kotlin: 
            The primary programming languages used for Android development.
        Android APIs: 
            A wide range of APIs that allow developers to access device features such as sensors, cameras, and location services.
        Android Jetpack: 
            A collection of libraries, tools, and guidance to help developers follow best practices and write maintainable code.





SDK features:
    An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of software tools and libraries that developers use 
    to create applications for specific platforms or frameworks. 
    Here are some common features typically found in SDKs:

        Libraries and APIs: 
            Pre-written code and interfaces that help developers interact with the platform's features and functionalities.

        Documentation: 
            Detailed guides and reference materials that explain how to use the SDK components effectively.

        Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Support: 
            Tools and plugins for popular IDEs to streamline the development process.

        Sample Code: 
            Example projects and snippets to help developers get started quickly.

        Testing Tools: 
            Utilities for debugging, testing, and profiling applications.

        Platform-Specific Tools: 
            Tools designed for the target platform, such as emulators or simulators for mobile devices.

        Versioning and Updates: 
            Mechanisms to keep the SDK up-to-date with the latest platform changes and improvements.

        Authentication and Security: 
            Features to manage user authentication, authorization, and secure communication.

        Performance Optimization: 
            Tools and libraries to help optimize the performance of applications.

        Support and Community: 
            Access to support channels and a community of developers for troubleshooting and collaboration.
