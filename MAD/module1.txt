Android development framework:
    The Android development framework is a comprehensive suite of tools and libraries that allow developers 
    to create applications for Android devices. 
    Android Native Development (Java/Kotlin): 
            This is the traditional approach using the official Android SDK. 
        It's great for full control over the hardware and features of the device.

    React Native: 
            A framework developed by Facebook that allows you to build mobile apps using JavaScript and React. 
        It enables code sharing across iOS and Android platforms.

    Flutter: 
            Created by Google, Flutter allows for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop 
        from a single codebase using the Dart programming language.

    Xamarin: 
        Owned by Microsoft, Xamarin uses C# and .NET to create cross-platform apps for Android, iOS, and Windows.

    Ionic: 
            A framework for building cross-platform mobile apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        It focuses on high performance and a native feel.

    PhoneGap/Cordova: 
            These frameworks allow you to build mobile apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        They are good for simpler apps or those that need to access native device features.

    NativeScript: 
        A framework for building native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and Angular, Vue.js, or TypeScript.



SDK features:
    An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of software tools and libraries that developers use 
    to create applications for specific platforms or frameworks. 
    Here are some common features typically found in SDKs:

        Libraries and APIs: 
            Pre-written code and interfaces that help developers interact with the platform's features and functionalities.

        Documentation: 
            Detailed guides and reference materials that explain how to use the SDK components effectively.

        Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Support: 
            Tools and plugins for popular IDEs to streamline the development process.

        Sample Code: 
            Example projects and snippets to help developers get started quickly.

        Testing Tools: 
            Utilities for debugging, testing, and profiling applications.

        Platform-Specific Tools: 
            Tools designed for the target platform, such as emulators or simulators for mobile devices.

        Versioning and Updates: 
            Mechanisms to keep the SDK up-to-date with the latest platform changes and improvements.

        Authentication and Security: 
            Features to manage user authentication, authorization, and secure communication.

        Performance Optimization: 
            Tools and libraries to help optimize the performance of applications.

        Support and Community: 
            Access to support channels and a community of developers for troubleshooting and collaboration.
